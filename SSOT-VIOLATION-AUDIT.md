# SSOT VIOLATION AUDIT: QOLAE-Readers-Dashboard

**Date:** 3rd December 2025
**Auditor:** Claude Code
**Status:** CLEAN - No violations found

---

## ARCHITECTURE RULE

**Parent Bridge dashboards must NEVER query database directly.**
All data access must go through SSOT API (`api.qolae.com`) via `fetch()`.

---

## AUDIT RESULT

**NO `pool.query` violations found in active code.**

This dashboard correctly follows SSOT architecture:
- All database access goes through SSOT API
- No direct database queries in route handlers
- Clean separation of concerns

---

## VERIFICATION

Searched for: `pool.query` in `/QOLAE-Readers-Dashboard/`
Result: No matches in active source files

---

## STATUS

**COMPLIANT** - No action required.
