READERS WORKFLOW.
1.The reader receives an email with a reader specific clickable PIN/ID number, which
directs them to a secure QOLAE Portal for the readers workspace.

2.Once they go through the 2 way/MF authentication, username and password, they will
go to the next stage.

3.The NDA is revealed and they can review and sign this form digitally.

4.Liz’s signature is applied once the reader ticks the box to send and a copy will be
made available to the reader in their workspace and also in Liz’s workspace.

5.Once the report is ready, an email will be sent to the First reader and a redacted copy
will be made available in the portal for review.

6.After sending off the corrected draft, the Reader will be paid immediately.

7.The second reader will be sent the second redacted draft and once they have
corrected the draft, they will also be paid immediately.

8.Access to the portal is then placed on hold for both readers, until the next time.
