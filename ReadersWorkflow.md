READERS WORKFLOW.
1.The reader receives an email with a reader specific clickable PIN/ID number, which
directs them to a secure QOLAE Portal for the readers workspace.

2.Once they go through the 2FA authentication, username and password, they will
go to the next stage.

3.The NDA is revealed and they can review and sign this form digitally.

4.Liz’s signature is applied once the reader ticks the box to send and a copy will be
made available to the reader in their workspace and also in Liz’s workspace.

5.Once the report is ready, an email will be sent to the First reader and a redacted copy will be made available in the portal for review.

6.After sending off the corrected draft, it will be reviewed by Liz and then the Reader will be paid following the review of the corrected draft.

7.The second reader will be sent the second redacted draft- uploaded to their Documents Library Modal and once they have completed correcting the draft and this has been reviewed by Liz/other CM, they will be paid.

8.Once their workflow has been completed, the redacted reports are sealed off.
